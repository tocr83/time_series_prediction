# time_series_prediction

A project for displaying global Covid mortalities and predicting Covid cases using FB Prophet model. 

The project first transforms and adjusts the data so format is more easy to work with.
It then assigns for each country the ISO Code and creates a categorical variable for ranges of mortalities.

We plot the total number of deaths per country on a global map.

Lastly, we plot a time series of global Covid cases and use the Facebook prophet model to predict the last 30 days of Covid cases in 2023.
